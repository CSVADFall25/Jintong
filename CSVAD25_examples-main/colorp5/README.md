# colorp5 - Color Theory & Interactive Experiments

A collection of p5.js projects exploring color theory, color relationships, and interactive color manipulation techniques.

## Basic Examples

#### **HSVExplorer**
Visual exploration of HSV/HSB color space:
- Mouse interaction to explore hue spectrum
- Three bars showing same hue at different brightness levels
- Real-time color space visualization

#### **AnalogousColor**
Explores analogous color relationships (adjacent colors on color wheel)

#### **ComplimentaryColor** 
Demonstrates complementary color theory (opposite colors on color wheel)

#### **TriadicTetraficColor**
Experiments with triadic (120° apart) and tetradic (90° apart) color schemes

#### **RelativeColor**
Studies how colors appear different when placed next to other colors

## Palette Examples

#### **PaletteExplorer**
Tool for creating and exploring color palettes

#### **AccentPalette**
Mouse-controlled base and accent color palette generator:
- **Horizontal mouse movement**: Controls hue (0-360°)
- **Vertical mouse movement**: Controls brightness
- Generates complementary accent colors automatically
- Creates palette variations with different brightness levels


## Advanced Examples 

#### **ColorNodes**
Interactive node-based color mixing system where you can:
- Create color nodes and connect them with gradient edges
- Manipulate hue, saturation, brightness, and size
- Explore color relationships through visual connections
- Use keyboard shortcuts for different editing modes

#### **ColorPartner** (HSB)
Generate color variations based on spatial relationships:
- Click and drag to create color swatches
- Colors vary based on distance from source
- Uses HSB color space for intuitive color mixing
- Interactive movement and color shifting modes

#### **ColorPartnerLab** (CIE L*a*b*)
Advanced version using perceptually uniform CIE L*a*b* color space:
- More accurate color mixing and interpolation
- Better representation of how humans perceive color differences
- Professional-grade color manipulation tools
